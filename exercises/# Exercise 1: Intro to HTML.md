# Intro to HTML

HTML elements: Browsers have standard styling for basic elements. HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between.

```
<tagname>content</tagname>
```

Above is the format that elements are written in. There are dozens of elements, but only a few are used commonly. Below is a list of a few of the more frequent elements used in themes.

`<h1>Headers range from 1-6</h1>`

`<p>Paragraph</p>`

`<ul>Unordered List</ul>`

`<li>List item</ul>`

`<strong>Bolding text</strong>`

`<a>Links</a>`

There are a handful of HTML elements which are "self-closing", so there is no content section between tags.  For example, the **image** element:

`<img src="picture of a cat.jpg>`

## Exercise 1:

In this first exercise, we are going to:

* write new content inside existing HTML tags,
