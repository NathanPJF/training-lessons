# HTML - Class attribute

Using the **class attribute** within HTML elements makes it possible to apply additional styling to elements. Example: make text red, or increasing font size.

Classes are defined in a markup language called "CSS". 

#### HTML
`<h3 class="notice">This is how CSS works</h3>`

#### CSS
```
.notice {
  color:red;
  font-size:16px;
}
```

The above code would make the heading "This is how CSS works" red, with a font size of 16px.

Classes are always defined as **class="class-name"**. 

`<h1 class="product-title">Title/h1>`

`<p class="product-description">Paragraph</p>`

You can have multiple values in the **class attribute** by separating them with a space.

`<h2 class="product-price sale">Unordered List</h2>`
