# HTML - Attributes

HTML elements can have **attributes** which provide additional information about that element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of the element.

```
<tagname name="value">content</tagname>
```

Attributes come in a **name/value pair**, such as: name="value".

Below is a list of a few of the more common attributes used in themes.


`<a href="http://www.website.com">Links</a>`

`<img src="http://www.website.com/images/picture.jpg">`

`<input type="checkbox">`
