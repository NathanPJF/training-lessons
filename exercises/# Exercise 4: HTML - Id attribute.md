# HTML - Id attribute

**ID attributes** are similar to class attributes in that they can be used to apply additional styling to elements.

#### HTML

```
<h2 id="promoText">Collection Title</h2>
```
#### CSS

```
#promoText{
  font-size: 64px;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

Unlike class attributes, an ID attribute can **only be used once on a page**. For our purposes, it is best practice *not* to use IDs and stick to using classes.

## Exercise 4:

Redesign this home page by applying `id` and `class` attributes as needed.

### Tasks

In addition to applying existing `id` and `class` attributes, you will need to make a CSS
change to one of the style properties.  In order to make the page look like the screenshot
below, be sure that the font color for everything is set to `white` or `#fff`.

*Pro tip*: You'll need to change some CSS.  I have full confidence in you!
