# HTML - Id attribute

ID attributes are similar to class attributes in that they are used to apply additional styling to elements. However, unlike class attributes, an ID attribute can only be used by one element on a page, whereas class attributes can be used by several elements on a page. It is best practice not to use IDs when a class can be used instead.

## Exercise 4:

Redesign this home page by applying `id` and `class` attributes as needed.

In addition to applying existing `id` and `class` attributes, you will need to make a CSS
change to one of the style properties.  In order to make the page look like the screenshot
below, be sure that the font color for everything is set to `white` or `#fff`.
