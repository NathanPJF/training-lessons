# HTML - Id attribute

**ID attributes** are similar to class attributes in that they can be used to apply additional styling to elements.

#### HTML

```
<h2 id="promoText">Collection Title</h2>
```
#### CSS

```
#promoText{
  font-size: 64px;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

Unlike class attributes, an ID attribute can **only be used once on a page**. For our purposes, it is best practice *not* to use IDs and stick to using classes.

## Exercise 4:

Redesign this home page by applying `id` and `class` attributes as needed.

### Tasks

Exercise link: Go to [HTML: Id attribute](http://codepen.io/NathanPJF/pen/MweBbq) and click on "Fork" in the top left after logging in. This will create your own unique link that you'll submit once your changes are done.

In addition to applying existing `id` and `class` attributes, you will need to make a CSS
change to one of the style properties.  In order to make the page look like the screenshot
below, be sure that the font color for everything is set to `white` or `#fff`.

*Pro tip*: You'll need to change one line of CSS in this exercise.  I have full confidence in you!
